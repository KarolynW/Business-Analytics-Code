    <h1>Handling Missing Data for Olympus Manufacturing</h1>

    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <p>
        Olympus Manufacturing, a UK-based company, operates two factories that produce industrial components for the automotive, construction, and consumer goods industries.
        Their manufacturing process involves sourcing raw materials, assembling components, conducting quality control checks, and distributing products to suppliers and businesses.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Recently, data analysts at Olympus Manufacturing have identified issues with missing data in their inventory, production, and distribution records.
        These gaps are creating inefficiencies in supply chain management, production scheduling, and quality assurance.
        Your task is to <strong>identify, summarise, visualise, and handle the missing data</strong> in the dataset provided.
    </p>

    <h2>Task: Detecting and Visualising Missing Data</h2>
    <p>
        You have been given a sample dataset (<strong>olympus_manufacturing_production.xlsx</strong>), which includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Inventory Levels</strong>: Records of raw material availability at both factory locations.</li>
        <li><strong>Production Data</strong>: Details of component assembly, including time taken and materials used.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality Control</strong>: Inspection reports indicating whether components meet manufacturing standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Distribution Records</strong>: Shipments from factories to suppliers and businesses.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>However, some key data points are missing, affecting:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stock levels</strong> in certain raw materials, leading to production delays.</li>
        <li><strong>Incomplete production data</strong>, making it difficult to track assembly efficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Missing quality control records</strong>, creating uncertainty about product defects.</li>
        <li><strong>Distribution gaps</strong>, where some shipments lack delivery status updates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Task</h2>
    <p>
        Your objective is to perform a missing data analysis using Python or R. Specifically, you need to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Load</strong> the dataset into Python or R.</li>
        <li><strong>Identify</strong> missing values and summarise them (count & percentage).</li>
        <li><strong>Visualise</strong> missing data using heatmaps and bar charts.</li>
        <li><strong>Interpret</strong> the missing data patterns and consider their potential impact on Olympus Manufacturingâ€™s operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Save and download</strong> all analysis outputs, including summaries and visualisations.</li>
    </ul>
