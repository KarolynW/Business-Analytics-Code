            <h2>Introduction to Data Imputation</h2>
            <p>
                Missing data is a common challenge in datasets used for business analytics. 
                Data imputation refers to techniques used to replace missing or null values with plausible estimates, 
                ensuring the integrity and usability of datasets for analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                This page provides an overview of four key data imputation techniques commonly used in analytics:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Imputation Validation:</strong> Assessing the accuracy of imputed data.</li>
                <li><strong>K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) Imputation:</strong> A technique based on the similarity of data points.</li>
                <li><strong>Mean/Median Imputation:</strong> Filling missing values with the mean or median of the dataset.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple Imputation:</strong> Advanced statistical methods to account for the uncertainty in missing data.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Imputation Validation</h2>
            <p>
                Validation ensures that imputed values are accurate and do not introduce bias into the dataset. Techniques like
                <strong>cross-validation</strong> are often employed to evaluate the imputation's effectiveness.

        <section>
            <h2>K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) Imputation</h2>
            <p>
                This method identifies <strong>K</strong> closest data points (neighbours) to the missing value based on distance metrics like
                Euclidean or Manhattan distance. The missing value is imputed as the average or majority value from these neighbours.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Advantages:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accounts for the relationship between variables.</li>
                    <li>Suitable for both numerical and categorical data.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Challenges:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Computationally intensive for large datasets.</li>
                    <li>May introduce bias if the dataset has significant outliers.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Mean/Median Imputation</h2>
            <p>
                A simple and efficient technique where missing values are replaced with the mean or median of the respective column.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Advantages:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quick and easy to implement.</li>
                    <li>Useful for datasets with small amounts of missing data.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Challenges:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can distort relationships between variables.</li>
                    <li>Not suitable for datasets with large amounts of missing data.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Multiple Imputation</h2>
            <p>
                A more sophisticated approach that generates multiple estimates for missing values, creating multiple datasets to reflect the uncertainty around missing data. These datasets are then aggregated for analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Advantages:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accounts for the uncertainty in missing data.</li>
                    <li>Maintains variability in the dataset.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Challenges:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Complex to implement and requires statistical expertise.</li>
                    <li>Computationally intensive for large datasets.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Choosing the right imputation technique depends on the nature of the data, the proportion of missing values, and the analysis goals. 
                These methods ensure that datasets remain robust and reliable for business analytics.
