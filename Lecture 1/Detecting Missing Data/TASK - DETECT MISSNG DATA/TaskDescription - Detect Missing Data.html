    <h1>Handling Missing Data for SwiftyRetail</h1>

    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <p>
        SwiftyRetail, a large nationwide retail chain, is facing challenges in managing inventory and customer orders due to missing data in their system. 
        The company operates both physical stores and an online platform, and they rely on accurate data to keep track of stock levels, customer purchases, and deliveries.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The data analysts at SwiftyRetail have identified that some key inventory and sales records contain missing values, making it difficult to ensure efficient stock distribution and customer satisfaction. 
        Your task is to <strong>identify, summarise, visualise, and handle the missing data</strong> in the dataset provided.
    </p>

    <h2>Task: Detecting and Visualising Missing Data</h2>
    <p>
        You have been given a sample dataset (<strong>swiftyretail_inventory_sales.xlsx</strong>), which includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inventory levels for various products across multiple store locations.</li>
        <li>Customer purchases, including order details from both online and in-store transactions.</li>
        <li>Delivery tracking, containing information about shipments from warehouses to stores and customers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>However, some key data points are missing, affecting:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stock levels</strong> in certain store locations.</li>
        <li><strong>Incomplete customer purchase records.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Missing delivery tracking information.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Task</h2>
    <p>
        Your objective is to perform a missing data analysis using Python or R. Specifically, you need to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Load</strong> the dataset into Python or R.</li>
        <li><strong>Identify</strong> missing values and summarise them (count & percentage).</li>
        <li><strong>Visualise</strong> missing data using heatmaps and bar charts.</li>
        <li><strong>Interpret</strong> the missing data patterns to determine the potential business impact.</li>
    </ul>
