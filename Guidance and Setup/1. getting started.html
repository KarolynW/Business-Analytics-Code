            <h2>Programming Languages: Python and R</h2>
            <p>
                This course uses two powerful programming languages: <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>R</strong>. Each has unique strengths that make them indispensable for business analytics:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Python:</strong> A versatile and beginner-friendly programming language widely used in the industry for data analysis, machine learning, and automation.</li>
                <li><strong>R:</strong> A language dedicated to statistical computing and data visualisation, known for its powerful analytical capabilities and graphing tools.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Although both are suitable for data analysis, the focus of each language differs:
