Interpreting the Results
Percentiles for SpendingScore
5th Percentile (4.93): Only 5% of customers have a spending score below 4.93. These are extremely low-spending customers.
25th Percentile (Q1, 24.87): 25% of customers have a spending score below 24.87. This represents the lower quartile of spending behavior.
50th Percentile (Median, 49.54): Half of the customers have a spending score below 49.54, marking the middle of the distribution.
75th Percentile (Q3, 75.55): 75% of customers have a spending score below 75.55, with the top 25% spending more than this value.
95th Percentile (95.06): The top 5% of customers spend above 95.06, indicating high-value customers.
Conclusion: The spending score is evenly distributed across its range, with a slight clustering around the median value.

Skewness and Kurtosis
AnnualIncome:

Skewness (3.97): Indicates a highly positive skew. The distribution has a long right tail, suggesting the presence of a few very high-income outliers.
Kurtosis (38.10): Extremely high kurtosis suggests the data has heavy tails and sharp peaks, further confirming the presence of significant outliers in income.
SpendingScore:

Skewness (0.01): Close to 0, indicating the data is nearly symmetric around its mean.
Kurtosis (-1.21): Negative kurtosis suggests a flatter distribution with fewer extreme values compared to a normal distribution.
Conclusion:

Annual Income: The data is heavily influenced by outliers, which should be addressed depending on the analysis goals (e.g., winsorization or log transformation).
Spending Score: The distribution is well-balanced and less prone to extreme values, making it reliable for segmentation and percentile analysis.
Key Takeaways
Percentile values reveal customer spending patterns, highlighting low, median, and high spenders.
The strong skewness and kurtosis of AnnualIncome call for careful consideration during analysis to mitigate the influence of outliers.
SpendingScore is suitable for straightforward statistical analysis due to its symmetry and low kurtosis.
