            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Visualising descriptive statistics helps in interpreting datasets and identifying patterns or anomalies. This section demonstrates four common techniques for visualising data:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heatmaps:</strong> Represent relationships between variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Histograms:</strong> Show frequency distributions of data.</li>
                <li><strong>Pair Plots:</strong> Explore relationships between multiple variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Rug Plots:</strong> Combine density curves with detailed data points.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Heatmaps</h2>
            <p>
                A <strong>heatmap</strong> is a visualisation tool that uses colour to represent data values in a matrix format. In the context of correlation analysis, 
                a heatmap provides a colour-coded representation of the correlation matrix, illustrating the strength and direction of relationships between numeric variables.
            </p>
            <h3>Why Use Heatmaps?</h3>
            <p>Heatmaps are invaluable for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identifying Relationships:</strong> Quickly spotting strong positive or negative correlations between variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Dimensionality Reduction:</strong> Highlighting redundant variables (e.g., highly correlated variables) to streamline analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Providing an intuitive overview of data relationships at an early analysis stage.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Understanding the Correlation Matrix</h3>
            <p>
                The correlation matrix is a tabular representation of correlation coefficients between variables. Key aspects include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Correlation Coefficient:</strong> A value between -1 and 1 indicating the relationship's strength and direction:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>-1:</strong> Perfect negative correlation (as one variable increases, the other decreases).</li>
                        <li><strong>0:</strong> No correlation.</li>
                        <li><strong>1:</strong> Perfect positive correlation (both variables move in the same direction).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Diagonal Values:</strong> Always 1, as they represent a variable's correlation with itself.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Python Example: Generating a Heatmap</h3>
            <p>
                The following Python code generates a heatmap to visualise the correlation matrix:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
        # Import necessary libraries
        import seaborn as sns
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        
        # Generate the correlation matrix
        correlation_matrix = data.corr()
        
        # Create a heatmap
        sns.heatmap(
            correlation_matrix, 
            annot=True,  # Display correlation values on the heatmap
            cmap="coolwarm",  # Use a diverging colour palette
            vmin=-1, vmax=1,  # Set colour scale limits
            linewidths=0.5  # Add gridlines for better readability
        )
        
        # Add a title and save the heatmap
        plt.title("Correlation Heatmap")
        plt.savefig("Correlation_Heatmap.png")
        plt.close()
            </code></pre>
            <h3>Visualisation Example</h3>
            <p>
                The heatmap below visualises correlations between numeric variables in a dataset:
            </p>
            <img src="/Business-Analytics-Code/Lecture%202/Visualising%20Descriptive%20Statistics/Heatmaps/output/Correlation_Heatmap.png" alt="Correlation Heatmap" style="width:100%;max-width:800px;">
            <h3>Interpreting the Heatmap</h3>
            <p>
                When analysing a heatmap, focus on the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Strong Positive Correlations (e.g., 0.7 to 1):</strong> Variables that increase together. For instance, "Advertising Spend" and "Sales" may show a high correlation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Strong Negative Correlations (e.g., -0.7 to -1):</strong> Variables that move inversely. For example, "Discount Percentage" and "Profit Margin."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Weak Correlations (e.g., -0.3 to 0.3):</strong> Variables with little to no relationship, suggesting independent behaviours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Clusters of Correlation:</strong> Groups of variables with high correlations, indicating potential redundancy.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Applications of Heatmaps in Business Analytics</h3>
            <p>
                Heatmaps play a critical role in various domains of business analytics:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Marketing Analytics:</strong> Identify relationships between advertising spend, customer acquisition, and revenue.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Analysis:</strong> Assess correlations between asset classes, aiding in portfolio diversification.</li>
                <li><strong>Operations Management:</strong> Analyse how variables like production cost, defects, and output interact.</li>
                <li><strong>Human Resources:</strong> Explore relationships between employee performance metrics and engagement surveys.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Limitations of Heatmaps</h3>
            <p>
                While heatmaps are powerful, they have limitations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interpretation Complexity:</strong> Heatmaps may become cluttered and hard to interpret with too many variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Correlation â‰  Causation:</strong> A strong correlation does not imply a cause-and-effect relationship.</li>
                <li><strong>Linear Relationships Only:</strong> Correlation measures linear relationships and may not capture non-linear dependencies.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Heatmaps are an indispensable tool for visualising relationships between variables. By providing a clear and intuitive overview of correlations, 
                they enable analysts to identify patterns, assess relationships, and make informed decisions. However, it is crucial to complement heatmaps 
                with other analyses to avoid misinterpreting correlations as causation.

            <h2>Histograms</h2>
            <p>
                A <strong>histogram</strong> is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. It divides the range of data into intervals (or bins) and counts 
                the number of data points within each interval, displaying the frequencies as bars. Histograms help analysts understand the shape, spread, and central tendency of the data.
            </p>
            <h3>Why Use Histograms?</h3>
            <p>
                Histograms are particularly useful for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Understanding Distribution:</strong> Identifying whether the data is normally distributed, skewed, or multimodal.</li>
                <li><strong>Detecting Outliers:</strong> Spotting intervals with unusually high or low frequencies.</li>
                <li><strong>Assessing Variability:</strong> Observing the spread of data across intervals.</li>
                <li><strong>Comparing Groups:</strong> Visualising and comparing distributions of subsets of the data (e.g., by region or demographic).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Python Example: Creating a Histogram</h3>
            <p>
                The following Python code generates a histogram of age data with an overlaid density curve for smoother visualisation:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
        # Import necessary libraries
        import seaborn as sns
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import pandas as pd
        
        # Sample data
        data = {"Age": [25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 30, 35, 45, 50, 55]}
        ages = pd.Series(data["Age"])
        
        # Generate histogram with density curve
        sns.histplot(ages, bins=10, kde=True, color="blue")
        plt.title("Age Distribution")
        plt.xlabel("Age")
        plt.ylabel("Frequency")
        plt.savefig("Age_Histogram.png")
        plt.close()
            </code></pre>
            <h3>Customisation Examples</h3>
            <p>
                The choice of bin size can significantly impact the interpretability of a histogram. Below are examples demonstrating the effect of different binning strategies:
            </p>
            <img src="/Business-Analytics-Code/Lecture%202/Visualising%20Descriptive%20Statistics/Histogram/output/Age_Default_Histogram.png" alt="Default Histogram" style="width:100%;max-width:800px;">
            <p><strong>Default binning:</strong> Provides a balanced overview of the data distribution, suitable for general analysis.</p>
            <img src="/Business-Analytics-Code/Lecture%202/Visualising%20Descriptive%20Statistics/Histogram/output/Age_20Bins_Histogram.png" alt="Histogram with 20 Bins" style="width:100%;max-width:800px;">
            <p><strong>20 bins:</strong> Adds granularity, useful for identifying subtle patterns or gaps in the data.</p>
            <img src="/Business-Analytics-Code/Lecture%202/Visualising%20Descriptive%20Statistics/Histogram/output/Age_50Bins_Histogram.png" alt="Histogram with 50 Bins" style="width:100%;max-width:800px;">
            <p><strong>50 bins:</strong> Highly granular but may overemphasise noise, making it less effective for broader trends.</p>
            <h3>Interpreting Histograms</h3>
            <p>
                Histograms provide valuable insights into the data:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Shape:</strong> The overall shape (e.g., normal, skewed, or bimodal) reveals underlying patterns in the data distribution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Spread:</strong> The width of the histogram indicates variability, with wider histograms representing more diverse datasets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Central Tendency:</strong> The position of the peak suggests where most data points are concentrated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Outliers:</strong> Isolated bars on either end of the histogram highlight extreme values.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>When to Use Histograms</h3>
            <p>
                Histograms are particularly effective during the <strong>exploratory data analysis (EDA)</strong> phase, where understanding data distributions is crucial. 
                They are well-suited for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Univariate Analysis:</strong> Examining the distribution of a single variable.</li>
                <li><strong>Outlier Detection:</strong> Identifying extreme values that could affect the analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Comparative Analysis:</strong> Comparing distributions across groups or categories.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Validation:</strong> Verifying that data behaves as expected (e.g., no unexpected gaps or peaks).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>
                While histograms are powerful tools, they have limitations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sensitivity to Bin Size:</strong> Too few bins oversimplify the data, while too many bins may overemphasise noise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Limited to One Variable:</strong> Histograms are univariate and do not capture relationships between variables.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Loss of Detail:</strong> Binning groups data, potentially hiding individual data points or finer patterns.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Histograms are essential tools for understanding data distributions. By adjusting bin sizes and overlaying density curves, 
                analysts can customise histograms to uncover meaningful patterns and gain deeper insights into their data. However, 
                like all visualisations, histograms should be used alongside other techniques to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

            <h2>Pair Plots</h2>
            <p>
                A <strong>pair plot</strong> visualises pairwise relationships between multiple variables in a dataset. By plotting scatterplots for numeric variables 
                and density/histograms along the diagonal, pair plots allow analysts to explore relationships, trends, clusters, and correlations in a single visualisation.
            </p>
            <h3>Why Use Pair Plots?</h3>
            <p>Pair plots are useful for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exploring Correlations:</strong> Identify relationships between pairs of variables (e.g., sales vs. advertising spend).</li>
                <li><strong>Detecting Clusters:</strong> Highlight groupings in data, especially when paired with a categorical variable for colour coding.</li>
                <li><strong>Analysing Multivariate Data:</strong> Understand how multiple variables interact with each other.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Components of a Pair Plot</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scatterplots:</strong> Plotted off-diagonal, showing the relationship between two variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Diagonal:</strong> Displays a density curve or histogram for each individual variable, indicating its distribution.</li>
                <li><strong>Hue:</strong> A categorical variable used to differentiate data points by colour, revealing group-level patterns.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Python Example: Generating a Pair Plot</h3>
            <p>
                The following Python code generates a pair plot for a dataset containing sales, advertising spend, and profit margin, with regions as a grouping variable:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
        # Import necessary libraries
        import seaborn as sns
        import pandas as pd
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        
        # Sample dataset
        data = pd.DataFrame({
            "Sales": [500, 600, 400, 800, 700],
            "Advertising Spend": [200, 300, 150, 400, 350],
            "Profit Margin": [20, 25, 15, 30, 28],
            "Region": ["North", "South", "East", "West", "North"]
        })
        
        # Generate pair plot
        sns.pairplot(data, hue="Region", diag_kind="kde", palette="Set2")
        
        # Save the plot
        plt.savefig("Pair_Plot_With_Hue.png")
        plt.close()
            </code></pre>
            <h3>Visualisation Example</h3>
            <p>
                The pair plot below visualises relationships between sales, advertising spend, and profit margin, grouped by region:
            </p>
            <img src="/Business-Analytics-Code/Lecture%202/Visualising%20Descriptive%20Statistics/Pair%20Plots/output/Pair_Plot_With_Hue.png" alt="Pair Plot with Hue" style="width:100%;max-width:800px;">
            <h3>Interpreting Pair Plots</h3>
            <p>
                Pair plots can reveal important patterns and insights, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Correlation:</strong> Positive, negative, or no correlation between variables is visible as linear, inverse, or random scatter patterns, respectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Clusters:</strong> Groupings of data points in scatterplots can indicate natural segmentation or relationships, especially with categorical grouping (hue).</li>
                <li><strong>Variable Distributions:</strong> The diagonal density plots reveal whether a variable is normally distributed, skewed, or bimodal.</li>
                <li><strong>Outliers:</strong> Isolated points in scatterplots indicate potential outliers that may need further investigation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Applications of Pair Plots</h3>
            <p>
                Pair plots are widely used in business analytics and other domains:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Customer Segmentation:</strong> Explore relationships between customer demographics and behaviours to define meaningful segments.</li>
                <li><strong>Marketing Analytics:</strong> Understand the interaction between advertising spend, sales, and profit margins to optimise campaigns.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Provide a quick overview of multivariate relationships in a dataset.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Identify potential features and relationships for building predictive models.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Limitations of Pair Plots</h3>
            <p>
                While pair plots are powerful, they do have some limitations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Pair plots become cluttered and hard to interpret with too many variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Categorical Variables:</strong> Pair plots are best suited for numeric data and may not fully capture the relationships involving categorical variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Static Nature:</strong> Static visualisations may not allow deeper interactivity needed for exploring large datasets dynamically.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Pair plots are an essential tool for analysing multivariate datasets. They provide a comprehensive overview of relationships, distributions, and clusters within the data, 
                making them invaluable for exploratory data analysis and feature engineering. By customising pair plots with hues and diagonal density plots, analysts can derive meaningful insights 
                and communicate data-driven stories effectively.

            <h2>Rug Plots</h2>
            <p>
                A <strong>rug plot</strong> is a visualisation technique that displays individual data points as small ticks along an axis. 
                When combined with a density curve, rug plots provide a detailed and granular view of data distributions. 
                They are particularly useful for identifying patterns, clusters, and outliers that may not be immediately visible in other visualisations.
            </p>
            <h3>Why Use Rug Plots?</h3>
            <p>Rug plots are valuable for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Granularity:</strong> Highlighting the exact position of individual data points within a distribution.</li>
                <li><strong>Complementing Density Plots:</strong> Providing additional context to density curves by showing raw data points.</li>
                <li><strong>Outlier Detection:</strong> Identifying isolated points that may represent outliers or anomalies.</li>

            <h3>Python Example: Creating a Rug Plot</h3>
            <p>The following Python code generates a rug plot combined with a density curve to visualise the distribution of spending scores:</p>
            <pre><code>
        # Import necessary libraries
        import seaborn as sns
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        
        # Sample data
        data = {"SpendingScore": [20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 50, 55, 45]}
        spending_scores = pd.Series(data["SpendingScore"])
        
        # Create density plot with a rug plot
        sns.kdeplot(spending_scores, fill=True, alpha=0.6, color="blue", label="Density Curve")
        sns.rugplot(spending_scores, color="red", height=0.1, label="Rug Plot")
        
        # Add title and legend
        plt.title("Rug Plot and Density for Spending Score")
        plt.xlabel("Spending Score")
        plt.ylabel("Density")
        plt.legend()
        plt.savefig("SpendingScore_Rug_Plot.png")
        plt.close()
            </code></pre>
            <h3>Visualisation Example</h3>

            <img src="/Business-Analytics-Code/Lecture%202/Visualising%20Descriptive%20Statistics/Rug%20Plots/output/SpendingScore_Rug_Plot.png" alt="Spending Score Rug Plot" style="width:100%;max-width:800px;">
            <h3>Interpreting Rug Plots</h3>
            <p>
                Rug plots provide detailed insights into the data distribution:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Clusters:</strong> Areas with many overlapping ticks indicate clusters or densely populated regions of the dataset.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Outliers:</strong> Isolated ticks far from the main data cluster highlight potential outliers or unusual values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Density Curve Context:</strong> The density curve provides a smoothed summary, while the rug plot ensures no granular detail is lost.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Applications of Rug Plots</h3>
            <p>
                Rug plots are particularly useful in the following scenarios:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Marketing Analytics:</strong> Explore customer segmentation by visualising individual spending patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Analysis:</strong> Identify anomalous transaction amounts in financial datasets.</li>
                <li><strong>Operations Management:</strong> Analyse defect rates or production quality distributions.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Combine with histograms or density plots for a comprehensive view of data distributions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Limitations of Rug Plots</h3>
            <p>
                While rug plots are effective for small datasets, they have limitations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Overcrowding:</strong> Rug plots can become cluttered and hard to interpret with large datasets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Static Nature:</strong> Without interactivity, rug plots may struggle to convey insights in very detailed datasets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Univariate Focus:</strong> Rug plots are limited to visualising one variable at a time.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Rug plots are a valuable addition to the analystâ€™s toolkit for visualising data distributions with granularity and precision. 
                When combined with density plots, they provide a comprehensive view of both the smoothed distribution and the raw data points. 
                However, care must be taken to ensure the dataset is of manageable size to avoid cluttering the visualisation. 
                Rug plots are most effective when used alongside other visualisations for exploratory data analysis and anomaly detection.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Data visualisation is a cornerstone of descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis (EDA). 
                By transforming raw data into clear and interpretable visuals, techniques such as <strong>heatmaps</strong>, <strong>histograms</strong>, <strong>pair plots</strong>, and <strong>rug plots</strong> empower analysts to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships that may not be apparent in numerical summaries alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each visualisation method serves a distinct purpose:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heatmaps:</strong> Simplify complex relationships between variables by using colour to highlight correlations and patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Histograms:</strong> Provide an intuitive overview of data distributions, revealing shapes, spread, and potential outliers.</li>
                <li><strong>Pair Plots:</strong> Enable multivariate analysis, uncovering relationships, clusters, and correlations across multiple variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Rug Plots:</strong> Add granularity to density plots, offering precise insights into individual data points.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Together, these techniques allow analysts to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify key patterns and relationships in data.</li>
                <li>Detect outliers and anomalies that may require further investigation.</li>
                <li>Communicate insights effectively through clear and engaging visuals.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Integrating Visualisation into the Analytical Process</h3>
            <p>
                Visualisations are not standalone tools; they are integral to the broader analytical process. 
                They play a critical role in:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Understanding the dataset before applying statistical or machine learning models.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Identifying and selecting variables for predictive modelling based on visual patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Decision-Making:</strong> Presenting data-driven recommendations to stakeholders in a visually compelling format.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Limitations and Best Practices</h3>
            <p>
                While visualisation techniques are powerful, they have limitations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overinterpretation:</strong> Visualisations can sometimes suggest patterns that are coincidental rather than meaningful.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Some methods, like pair plots or rug plots, may become cluttered with large datasets.</li>
                <li><strong>Subjectivity:</strong> Choice of colours, scales, and bin sizes can influence perception, requiring careful design to avoid bias.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To maximise the effectiveness of visualisations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose the appropriate technique for the data and analysis goals.</li>
                <li>Combine multiple visualisations for a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.</li>
                <li>Ensure clarity and simplicity in design to avoid misinterpretation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                Visualisation techniques are indispensable tools for modern data analysis. By effectively leveraging heatmaps, histograms, pair plots, and rug plots, analysts can 
                enhance their understanding of datasets, communicate findings effectively, and make data-driven decisions with confidence. 
                When used thoughtfully and in conjunction with other analytical techniques, these visualisations unlock deeper insights and pave the way for meaningful outcomes.
