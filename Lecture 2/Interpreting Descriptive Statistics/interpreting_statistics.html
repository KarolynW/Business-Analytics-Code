            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Descriptive statistics offer a foundation for interpreting and analysing data. This example demonstrates a step-by-step walkthrough 
                of interpreting key metrics using Python scripts and visualisations. We explore measures like central tendency, distribution, 
                segmentation, and correlation to extract meaningful insights.

            <h2>Step 1: Exploring Sales Distribution</h2>
            <p>
                In this step, we calculate basic descriptive statistics for monthly sales, such as mean, median, range, variance, and standard deviation. 
                These metrics provide insight into the central tendency, variability, and overall distribution of sales performance across stores.
            </p>
            <h3>Key Metrics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mean Monthly Sales:</strong> $16,688.00</li>
                <li><strong>Median Monthly Sales:</strong> $16,650.00</li>
                <li><strong>Range of Monthly Sales:</strong> $14,900.00</li>
                <li><strong>Variance of Monthly Sales:</strong> $15,893,456.00</li>
                <li><strong>Standard Deviation of Monthly Sales:</strong> $3,986.66</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                - <strong>Variability:</strong> The standard deviation of $3,986.66 indicates high variability in sales performance, highlighting significant differences between stores.<br>
                - <strong>Skewness:</strong> The similarity between the mean ($16,688.00) and median ($16,650.00) indicates minimal skewness in the sales data.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Top Performers:</strong> Stores with the highest sales include Store 26 ($25,000.00) and Store 30 ($24,500.00).<br>
                <strong>Low Performers:</strong> Stores with the lowest sales include Store 20 ($10,100.00) and Store 19 ($10,200.00).
            </p>
            <h3>Visualisation: Monthly Sales Distribution</h3>
            <p>
                The histogram below shows the frequency distribution of monthly sales. The dashed lines represent the mean (red) and median (green), demonstrating that most stores cluster around these values, with a few outliers at both ends.
            </p>

            <h3>Visualisation: Monthly Sales Boxplot</h3>
            <p>
                The boxplot below highlights the spread of sales, with the box representing the interquartile range (IQR) and the whiskers showing the range of the data (excluding outliers). The absence of extreme outliers indicates a relatively normal spread.
            </p>

            <h3>Reporting Guidelines</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Peer-Reviewed Research:</strong> When reporting these metrics in an academic context, include clear definitions, statistical significance tests, and context-specific implications. For instance:
                <blockquote>
                    "The dataset's standard deviation ($3,986.66) reflects high variability, suggesting significant disparities between store performances (range: $10,100.00 - $25,000.00). The similarity between the mean ($16,688.00) and median ($16,650.00) suggests minimal skewness, supporting the assumption of normality."
                </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Business Stakeholders:</strong> For non-technical audiences, focus on actionable insights:
                <blockquote>
                    "The average store generates $16,688.00 monthly in sales, with top performers achieving up to $25,000.00. However, high variability indicates opportunities to support underperforming stores, which average just $10,100.00 in sales."
                </blockquote>
            </p>

            <h2>Step 2: Segmenting Stores by Performance</h2>
            <p>
                Stores are classified into performance tiers based on sales percentiles:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bottom 25%:</strong> Underperforming stores.</li>
                <li><strong>Middle Performers:</strong> Stores performing close to average.</li>
                <li><strong>Top 10%:</strong> High-performing stores.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Visualisation: Segment Summary</h3>
            <p>
                The bar chart and line plot below summarise key metrics for each performance tier:

        <section>
            <h2>Step 3: Exploring Relationships Between Metrics</h2>
            <p>
                This step explores correlations between key metrics (e.g., sales, footfall, advertising spend). Correlation heatmaps and boxplots 
                highlight relationships and performance differences across regions.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                This example demonstrates how to interpret descriptive statistics to extract meaningful insights. By combining metrics, visualisations, 
                and segmentations, businesses can better understand their data and make informed decisions.
